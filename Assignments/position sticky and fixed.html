    The Asian lion population has recovered from the brink of extinction to several hundred individuals. They occupy
    remnant forest habitats in the two hill systems of Gir and Girnar that comprise Gujarat’s largest tracts of dry
    deciduous forest, thorny forest and savannah. Five protected areas currently exist to protect the Asian lion: Gir
    Sanctuary, Gir National Park and Pania Sanctuary to form the Gir Conservation Area (GCA) covering an area of 20,000
    km2 of forest representing the core habitat for the Asiatic lion. The other two wildlife sanctuaries, Mitiyala and
    Girnar, protect satellite areas within dispersal distance of the Gir Conservation Area. An additional sanctuary is
    being established in the nearby Barda forest to serve as an alternative home for Gir lions.The Asian lion population
